# MyPortfolio

Hi there! I'm M. Talha, an Android app developer with 3 years of experience. I love turning ideas into user-friendly apps that just work.

I'm all about clean code and creating apps that people enjoy using. From coming up with the concept to making it happen with Java and Kotlin in Android Studio, I've got it covered.

Check out my portfolio to see how I've made everyday tasks easier with my apps. I'm not just into coding; I'm passionate about making technology that feels good to use.
